.SH Ruby 2.4 platform for building and running applications
.PP
This repository contains the source for building various versions of
the Ruby application as a reproducible Docker image using

Users can choose between RHEL and CentOS based builder images.
The resulting image can be run using 
\[la]http://docker.io\[ra].

.SH Environment variables
.PP
To set these environment variables, you can place them as a key value pair into a \fB\fC.sti/environment\fR
file inside your source code repository.
.IP \n+[step]

\item 
.PP
\fBRACK\_ENV\fP
.PP
This variable specifies the environment where the Ruby application will be deployed (unless overwritten) \- \fB\fCproduction\fR, \fB\fCdevelopment\fR, \fB\fCtest\fR.
Each level has different behaviors in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, ruby gem installation, etc.

.PP
\fBNote\fP: Application assets will be compiled only if the \fB\fCRACK\_ENV\fR is set to \fB\fCproduction\fR
\item 
.PP
\fBDISABLE\_ASSET\_COMPILATION\fP
.PP
This variable set to \fB\fCtrue\fR indicates that the asset compilation process will be skipped. Since this only takes place
when the application is run in the \fB\fCproduction\fR environment, it should only be used when assets are already compiled.
\item 
.PP
\fBPUMA\_MIN\_THREADS\fP, \fBPUMA\_MAX\_THREADS\fP
.PP
These variables indicate the minimum and maximum threads that will be available in 
\[la]https://github.com/puma/puma\[ra]'s thread pool.
\item 
.PP
\fBPUMA\_WORKERS\fP
.PP
This variable indicate the number of worker processes that will be launched. See documentation on Puma's 
\[la]https://github.com/puma/puma#clustered-mode\[ra].
.SH Hot deploy

In order to dynamically pick up changes made in your application source code, you need to make following steps:

\item 
.PP
\fBFor Ruby on Rails applications\fP
.PP
Run the built Rails image with the \fB\fCRAILS\_ENV=development\fR environment variable passed to the 
\[la]http://docker.io\[ra] \fB\fC\-e\fR run flag:
\fB\fC
$ docker run \-e RAILS\_ENV=development \-p 8080:8080 rails\-app
\fR
\item 
.PP
\fBFor other types of Ruby applications (Sinatra, Padrino, etc.)\fP
.PP
Your application needs to be built with one of gems that reloads the server every time changes in source code are done inside the running container. Those gems are:

\[la]https://github.com/alexch/rerun\[ra]
\item 
\[la]https://github.com/johnbintz/rack-livereload\[ra]
.PP
Please note that in order to be able to run your application in development mode, you need to modify the 
\[la]https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image#anatomy-of-a-builder-image\[ra], so the web server is launched by the chosen gem, which checks for changes in the source code.

.PP
After you built your application image with your version of 
\[la]https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image#anatomy-of-a-builder-image\[ra], run the image with the RACK\_ENV=development environment variable passed to the 
\[la]http://docker.io\[ra] \-e run flag:
\fB\fC
$ docker run \-e RACK\_ENV=development \-p 8080:8080 sinatra\-app
\fR
.PP
To change your source code in running container, use Docker's 
\[la]http://docker.io\[ra] command:

.PP
.RS

.nf
docker exec \-it <CONTAINER\_ID> /bin/bash

.fi
.RE

.PP
After you 
\[la]http://docker.io\[ra] into the running container, your current
directory is set to \fB\fC/opt/app\-root/src\fR, where the source code is located.

.SH Performance tuning
.PP
You can tune the number of threads per worker using the
\fB\fCPUMA\_MIN\_THREADS\fR and \fB\fCPUMA\_MAX\_THREADS\fR environment variables.
Additionally, the number of worker processes is determined by the number of CPU
cores that the container has available, as recommended by

\[la]https://github.com/puma/puma\[ra]'s documentation. This is determined using
the cgroup 
\[la]https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/cpusets.txt\[ra]
subsystem. You can specify the cores that the container is allowed to use by passing
the \fB\fC\-\-cpuset\-cpus\fR parameter to the 
\[la]http://docker.io\[ra] run command:

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ docker run \-e PUMA\_MAX\_THREADS=32 \-\-cpuset\-cpus='0\-2,3,5' \-p 8080:8080 sinatra\-app

.fi
.RE

.PP
The number of workers is also limited by the memory limit that is enforced using
cgroups. The builder image assumes that you will need 50 MiB as a base and
another 15 MiB for every worker process plus 128 KiB for each thread. Note that
each worker has its own threads, so the total memory required for the whole
container is computed using the following formula:

.PP
.RS

.nf
50 + 15 * WORKERS + 0.125 * WORKERS * PUMA\_MAX\_THREADS

.fi
.RE

.PP
You can specify a memory limit using the \fB\fC\-\-memory\fR flag:

.PP
.RS

.nf
$ docker run \-e PUMA\_MAX\_THREADS=32 \-\-memory=300m \-p 8080:8080 sinatra\-app

.fi
.RE

.PP
If memory is more limiting then the number of available cores, the number of
workers is scaled down accordingly to fit the above formula. The number of
workers can also be set explicitly by setting \fB\fCPUMA\_WORKERS\fR.
